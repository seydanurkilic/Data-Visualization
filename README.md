####  THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON AVIATION SECTOR 

## Step A: Problem Description

#### The COVID-19 epidemic, which started in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, affected the whole world. With the spread of the epidemic, economic activities related to global trade decreased and air transport operations declined. In line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization, countries have first restricted air transportation and then stopped most of their flight activities by closing their borders to protect against the contagious effect of COVID-19. These developments caused a decrease in aviation sector revenues and increased the financial losses of other sectors related to the aviation sector.

## The Story of The Problem

#### My reason for researching this subject is the reason why I wonder about the impact of covid on the transportation and communication sector. We have been in the covid 19 processes for more than 1 year. During this period, there were many times that I had to travel. One of my first choices when traveling within the country was the plane. I chose the airline both in terms of using time more economically and because I think it is safer. During my travels, I wondered and questioned how the pandemic affected the airlines. That's why, when I had this opportunity, I wanted to work on this subject while I was able to prepare a working environment. To satisfy my curiosity and to have more detailed information and make a good analysis at the end will strengthen my research and knowledge on this subject. I had a bit of trouble searching for his dataset. Generally, I always came across data on the same or similar issues. One of the mistakes I noticed during the research was first to search the data set. So I lost some time. When I changed my research style and keywords, it became easier for me to access the information I wanted. First determining the subject and then researching the dataset by subject enabled me to reach a quick result.
