THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON AVIATION SECTOR
The COVID-19 epidemic, which started in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, affected the whole world.
With the spread of the epidemic, economic activities related to global trade decreased and air transport operations declined. In line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization, countries have first restricted air transportation and then stopped most of their flight activities by closing their borders to protect against the contagious effect of COVID-19. These developments caused a decrease in aviation sector revenues and increased the financial losses of other sectors related to the aviation sector.
